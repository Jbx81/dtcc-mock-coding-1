Scenario:
DTCC is building a dashboard for digital asset transactions. You need to create a reusable, performant table component in React that:
•	Fetches transaction data from a REST API.
•	Supports sorting and filtering.
•	Displays loading and error states.
•	Uses React hooks for state management.
•	Includes unit tests for key functionality.
Requirements:
•	React: Use hooks, context or Redux for state, Jest for tests.
•	Bonus: Optimize for large datasets (virtual scrolling or pagination).
What to Practice:
•	Designing the component architecture.
•	Implementing API integration and error handling.
•	Writing clean, maintainable code.
•	Creating unit tests for sorting/filtering logic.
•	Documenting your approach and decisions.
